The messy cartesian organization of the information we could find in the fields of data and computer science needs to be written in order to be understood.
Because the goal of this blog is to quickly render some ideas, this process has to be fast and the production easy to read. 

To be able to share some experiments and meet these goals, I chose **Pelican** and a base theme from **pelican-theme** to begin blogging about my discoveries.
Pelican_ is an easy to learn, clean and efficient tool to be able to quickly publish some content online.
Because I write my Python package documentation using Sphinx_ with reStructuredText_ I keep using the same markup language.

Hosting the blog on Github_ is a good idea since the majority of the tutorials use this platform and there is a nice integration option in Pelican.
From the first look, these tool are good candidates to start sharing and they have a lot of custom options.

The next post will describe all the steps to have a working configuration of Pelican.
